## About
This is my graduation project, made from ground up, using Laravel and VueJS.

This app allows users to draw abstract shapes and save them as image, using Web Audio API and P5.js.

You will also find that, I used different approaches for similar tasks, this is because I wanted to explore more Laravel.

## Technologies used in this project

* VueJS 2
* P5.js
